Introduction
The automotive industry has witnessed significant transformation in pricing mechanisms for used vehicles. Traditional approaches relied heavily on manual expertise and rule-based systems, while modern solutions leverage advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. This literature review examines the evolution of car price prediction methodologies, analyzing their strengths, limitations, and practical applications.
Problem Definition in Literature
Vehicle price prediction has been consistently defined in academic literature as a regression problem where the goal is to estimate the monetary value of a used car based on its characteristics and market conditions. The complexity arises from:
• Non-linear depreciation curves
• Market volatility and external factors
• Brand perception and consumer preferences
• Regional variations in pricing
• Seasonal demand fluctuations
